Find My Midwife

A web app where midwifes and mom's (or soon to be mom's) can find each other in a stress free way. Mom's can directly search for midwifes using filters of location and availability so that they only get useful results. 

It is also a great worktool for midwifes because it allows them to have everything they need in one place: patient details, work chat, notes and calendar.
